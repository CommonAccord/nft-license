Ti=License to Collectible Image

0.sec=For the promises received and given and other good and valuable consideration, including the purchase price, if any, paid for the Collectible, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Creator hereby grants to each Collector a license to the Collectible Image, upon the following terms and conditions and the other terms and conditions of these Terms: 

PaidUp.sec=The license is perpetual, fully paid up and worldwide.

Exclusivity.sec=The license is exclusive to the Collectors and Sublicensees, on the terms set forth in Section {License.Exclusive.Xnum} hereof.

PersonalUse.sec=The Collector may make personal and non-commercial use of the Collectible Image, solely as part of the Collectible (the “Personal Use Right”). Non-commercial uses are uses that are not promotional, advertorial or involved in merchandising or otherwise commercial. 

Resale.sec=The Collector may sell, transfer, or assign all (but not less than all) of its right, title, and interest in and to the {_NFT} associated with the Collectible (a “Resale”), and upon such Resale, all of the Collector’s rights and interests in and to the Collectible, including all of the Collector’s rights and interests in and to the Collectible Image, will be considered sold, transferred, or assigned, as the case may be, to the buyer, transferee, or assignee of such {_NFT} along with the {_NFT} itself (the “Resale Right”). The Collector’s rights, title and interest in the Collectible may not be assigned, sold or transferred, in whole or in part, to any person and the Resale Right may not be exercised, in whole or in part, without a sale and transfer of the {_NFT} associated with the Collectible to the assignee, purchaser or transferee, as applicable.

Sublicense.sec=The Collector may sublicense the Collector’s Personal Use Rights in the Collectible Image to the lawful operators of websites, the user interfaces of software applications, virtual museums or virtual galleries, or physical museums or physical galleries (if such physical museum or physical gallery solely displays the Collectible Image on a screen while the {_NFT} is held in escrow for such purpose) (“Sublicensees”), in each case, for the purposes of: (A) displaying the Collectible Image as part of the Collectible to the public for educational, non-commercial or cultural purposes without any compensation being paid to the Collector; or (B) displaying the Collectible in connection with sale, trading or transfer transactions in the Collectible in accordance with the Resale Right. In each case, the relevant Sublicensee must display the Collectible Image under circumstances reasonably intended to highlight the association of the Collectible Image with the {_NFT} as part of the Collectible. Notwithstanding the otherwise personal and non-commercial nature of the Personal Use Right and the restrictions set forth in Section {License.Xnum}, the use of the Collectible Image by a Sublicensee consistent with the uses stated in this paragraph may have a commercial purpose for the Sublicensee pursuant to its general business of displaying and facilitating trading in images and other information regarding {_NFT}-based art collectibles, promoting such business and collecting fees or commissions in connection with such business.
